## What is the Storage Service?

The Storage Service is a simple, secure way to store and retrieve data and files. You choose whether your data is **public** (anyone with the link can read it) or **private** (automatically encrypted so that only the key holder can access it).

## Origin

Originally developed as part of the United Nations Transparency Protocol (UNTP) reference implementation, the Storage Service is a general-purpose solution suitable for any application that needs secure document and file storage.

## Key Capabilities

- **Store data publicly or privately** -- choose the right level of protection for each piece of content.
- **Automatic encryption for private data** -- the service handles encryption for you; no cryptographic expertise required.
- **Multiple cloud storage backends** -- deploy with AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or any S3-compatible provider.
- **Data integrity verification** -- every stored item receives a unique hash fingerprint, so you can confirm your data has not been tampered with.
- **Simple REST API** -- a straightforward interface that developers can integrate with in minutes.

## Where to Go Next
